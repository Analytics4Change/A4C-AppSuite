# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical and deprecated documentation that is no longer current but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

Archived documentation includes:
- Documentation for deprecated features or systems (e.g., Zitadel authentication)
- Historical architecture decisions that have been superseded
- Migration documentation from previous approaches
- Old implementation plans that were completed or abandoned

## Usage

Archived documentation should:
- Be clearly marked with `status: archived` in YAML frontmatter
- Include deprecation date and reason
- Link to current documentation for the replacement approach (if applicable)
- Be preserved for historical context and understanding evolution of the system

## Status

All documents in this directory are considered **archived** and should not be used as reference for current implementation. Always consult the active documentation in the parent directories for current approaches.

## Examples of Archived Content

Archived content will be organized into subdirectories by topic:
- `zitadel-migration/` - Documentation from the Zitadel authentication system (replaced by Supabase Auth)
- `provider-management-v1/` - First version of provider management (replaced by current implementation)

More archived content will be added here as documentation is consolidated.
