# Reference Code Archive

This directory contains code that was written but never deployed to production. These files are kept for reference purposes only.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

- **Learning resource**: Contains useful patterns (circuit breaker, retry logic)
- **Historical context**: Documents architectural decisions and evolution
- **Future reference**: May be useful for understanding original design intentions

## Archived Files

*No archived files currently. Previous Zitadel-related reference files were deleted as part of the complete migration to Supabase Auth (November 2025).*

## Usage

These files are **NOT** included in production deployments. They exist only for:
- Reference when implementing similar patterns
- Documentation of architectural evolution
- Training and onboarding materials

Do not source or execute these files in production environments.
