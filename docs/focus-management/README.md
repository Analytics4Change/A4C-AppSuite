# Focus Management System Documentation Index

## Overview
This directory contains all documentation related to the focus management system rearchitecture project. The goal is to migrate from a complex, timeout-dependent focus system to a clean, unified architecture using FocusManagerContext + Radix UI.

## Migration Status
- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All core components built
- **Phase 2 (Component Migration)**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Task 008 ready to begin
- **Phase 3 (Flow Configuration)**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING - Waiting on Phase 2
- **Phase 4 (Testing & Validation)**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING - Waiting on Phase 2
- **Phase 5 (Cleanup & Optimization)**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING - Waiting on Phase 4

## Quick Reference

### For New Agents Starting Work
1. Read this README first
2. Load `focus-rearchitecture.md` (target state)
3. Load `current-focus-flow.md` (current state)
4. Load `focus-migration-tasks.md` and find your task
5. Read task-specific Required Reading sections

### Component Locations
- **New Focus System**: `/src/contexts/focus/`
- **New Components**: `/src/components/focus/`
- **Tests**: `__tests__` subdirectories
- **Current Components**: `/src/views/medication/`

### Key Patterns to Follow
- ‚úÖ Use FocusManagerContext for all focus management
- ‚úÖ Use ManagedDialog for all modals
- ‚úÖ Use FocusableField for all form fields
- ‚ùå No setTimeout for focus operations
- ‚ùå No manual focus() calls
- ‚ùå No onFocus auto-open handlers

### Available Sub-Agents
- **software-architect-dbc**: Architecture and analysis tasks
- **systems-architect**: Alternative for complex architecture
- **fullstack-engineer-tdd**: Component implementation
- **qa-test-engineer**: Testing and validation

## Critical Information

### Complexity Points Being Addressed
1. Mixed focus patterns (auto-open vs manual)
2. Heavy reliance on 50ms/100ms timeouts
3. Validation blocking without escape
4. No escape hatch in modals
5. Tab prevention breaking standard navigation
6. State coupling with ViewModel
7. Auto-open modals on focus events
8. Complex nested modal flows
9. Missing SideEffectsSelection implementation

### Success Metrics
- Focus transition time: <100ms (currently 50-100ms timeouts)
- Modal open/close: <150ms
- Memory usage: <5MB
- Test coverage: >90%
- Accessibility score: 100

### Next Priority Tasks
1. **Task 008**: Migrate MedicationSearch (SPLIT REQUIRED - see medication-search-analysis.md)
2. **Task 009**: Analyze DosageForm
3. **Task 010**: Migrate DosageForm

## Notes for Project Orchestrator
- Infrastructure phase (Tasks 001-006) is complete
- All documentation has been centralized here for easy access
- Agent assignments have been corrected to match available agents
- Document paths are now absolute for clarity
- Task 008 needs to be split into 3 sub-tasks due to complexity (7/10)
- Consider using systems-architect for particularly complex analysis tasks
