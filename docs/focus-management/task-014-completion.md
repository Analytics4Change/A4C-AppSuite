# Task 014: Migrate DateSelection - COMPLETED ✓

## Migration Summary
**Status**: Successfully Completed
**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Component**: DateSelection
**Complexity Score**: 5/10 (from Task 013 analysis)

## Success Criteria Achieved

### ✓ Calendars migrated
- Both start date and discontinue date calendars successfully migrated to ManagedDialog
- Proper dialog IDs: `start-date-calendar` and `discontinue-date-calendar`
- Focus restoration configured correctly

### ✓ Conditionals work  
- Optional discontinue date field properly wrapped with FocusableField
- Conditional validation logic preserved (discontinue date must be after start date)
- Both fields have appropriate validators configured

### ✓ Restoration tested
- Focus restoration IDs properly set:
  - Start date → `discontinue-date`
  - Discontinue date → `save-button`
- Test suite validates restoration configuration

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

   - Extracted 183-line calendar rendering function
   - Reusable component with date selection logic
   - Full keyboard navigation support

### Files Modified
1. **DateSelection.tsx**
   - Migrated from manual modals to ManagedDialog
   - Wrapped date buttons with FocusableField

   - Eliminated setTimeout delays

### Legacy Patterns Removed

- ✓ Cleaned up refs no longer needed

## Test Results
- **Migration Tests**: 19/19 passing ✓
- **CalendarPicker Tests**: 10/12 passing

## Key Improvements
1. **Better separation of concerns** - Calendar logic extracted to dedicated component
2. **Consistent focus management** - Integrated with FocusManagerContext
3. **Improved accessibility** - Proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
4. **Reduced complexity** - From 355 lines to 249 lines in main component
