**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Critical Fix Applied**: 2025-01-19 7:40 PM - Fixed selector ambiguity issue
**Dependencies**: task-001 (✅ COMPLETED - FocusManagerContext exists in src/contexts/focus/)
**Required Reading**:

- The MedicationSearch component is already wrapped with FocusableField in MedicationEntryModal.tsx
- Proper validators (canReceiveFocus, canLeaveFocus) are configured
- onComplete condition checks selectedMedication
- Mouse override and step indicator are properly configured
- Tests exist but have environment issues (5 passing, 18 failing due to jsdom focus limitations)

##### Task 008a: FocusableField Wrapper Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-18

**Known Issues** (Updated severity after remediation):
1. ✅ RESOLVED: Test environment limitations fixed with enhanced focus helper (91.3% pass rate achieved)
2. ⚠️ PENDING: Validator logic allows bypassing medication selection when no results (LOW severity)
3. ⚠️ PENDING: Mouse click capture configuration might cause dropdown interaction issues (LOW severity)

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Documentation Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Before starting ANY task, agents MUST:
1. Load and review focus-rearchitecture.md for target architecture understanding
2. Load and review current-focus-flow.md for current implementation context
3. Review the specific "Required Reading" sections listed in their task
4. Reference these documents throughout implementation

## Task Completion Protocol

### Overview
**Every agent MUST follow this protocol when working on and completing tasks.** This ensures consistent progress tracking, clear communication between agents, and verifiable completion of all work items.

### Task Status Legend
- **[ ]** Not started - Task has not been begun
- **[x]** Completed - Individual checklist item is complete
- **✅ COMPLETED** - Task fully verified with all success criteria met
- **⚠️ PARTIAL** - Some items complete but blocked or needs review
- **❌ BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

### Pre-Task Requirements
Before beginning any task:
1. **Verify Dependencies**: Check that all listed dependency tasks show ✅ COMPLETED status
2. **Load Required Documentation**: Read all documents listed in "Required Reading" section
3. **Review References**: Check findings from referenced tasks
4. **Update Status**: Add timestamp when starting work (e.g., "Started: 2025-01-15 10:30 AM")

**Document Priority Order for Loading**:
1. First: `/home/lars/dev/A4C-FrontEnd/docs/focus-management/focus-rearchitecture.md` (target architecture)
2. Second: `/home/lars/dev/A4C-FrontEnd/docs/focus-management/current-focus-flow.md` (current state)
3. Then: Task-specific documents as listed in Required Reading

### During Task Execution

#### Checklist Item Updates
As you work through the task:
1. **Mark items in real-time**: Update [x] as each checklist item is completed
2. **Add inline notes**: Include brief implementation notes after completed items
   ```
   - [x] Create base context with registry system (implemented in src/contexts/focus/)
   ```
3. **Document blockers**: If an item cannot be completed, note the reason
   ```
   - [ ] Add keyboard handlers ⚠️ BLOCKED: Waiting for Task 001 context implementation
   ```

#### Implementation Notes
Add detailed notes in the **Implementation Notes** section of your task:
- File paths created or modified
- Key design decisions made
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Deviations from the original plan with justification
- Performance measurements or test results
- Integration points with other components

### Success Criteria Verification

#### Verification Process
**Each success criterion MUST be individually verified before marking the task complete:**

1. **Test Each Criterion**: Run specific tests to verify each success point
2. **Mark with Checkmark**: Add ✓ after verified criteria
3. **Provide Evidence**: Include test output, screenshots, or metrics as proof
4. **Document Failures**: If a criterion cannot be met, mark with ✗ and explain

#### Evidence Documentation Format
```
**Success Criteria**: 
- Context created ✓ (FocusManagerContext.tsx implemented and exports working)
- Registry working ✓ (Unit tests passing: 15/15 tests)  
- Navigation tested ✓ (Manual testing completed, Tab/Enter/Arrow keys functional)
- Modal stack functional ✗ (Nested modals not fully working - see notes)
```

#### Handling Unmet Criteria
If success criteria cannot be fully met:
1. **Do NOT mark task as ✅ COMPLETED**
2. **Use ⚠️ PARTIAL status** with explanation
3. **Document the specific issue** in Implementation Notes
4. **Create follow-up task** if needed
5. **Note impact on dependent tasks**

### Task Completion Steps

#### Final Verification Checklist
Before marking a task as ✅ COMPLETED:
- [ ] All checklist items marked [x] or documented as blocked
- [ ] All success criteria verified with ✓ marks
- [ ] Implementation notes added with file paths and decisions
- [ ] Test results or evidence provided
- [ ] Dependencies for next tasks verified as unblocked
- [ ] Cross-references to affected tasks added

#### Completion Documentation
When completing a task, update the task header:
```markdown
#### Task 001: Core FocusManagerContext [fullstack-architect] ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-01-15 2:45 PM
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Required Reading**: [sections remain as is]
```

### Cross-Task Impact Documentation

#### Updating Affected Tasks
When your implementation affects other tasks:
1. **Add reference notes** to impacted tasks
2. **Update dependencies** if new ones are discovered
3. **Document API changes** that affect integration
4. **Note breaking changes** prominently

#### Reference Format
```markdown
**References**: task-001 (FocusManagerContext API), task-003 (modal patterns)
**Impact from task-008**: MedicationSearch now uses FocusableField wrapper
```

### Handoff Protocol

#### For Partially Complete Tasks
If handing off an incomplete task:
1. Mark status as ⚠️ PARTIAL
2. List completed items with [x]
3. Document work in progress
4. Note blockers or challenges
5. Provide clear next steps

#### For Blocked Tasks
If a task becomes blocked:
1. Mark status as ❌ BLOCKED
2. Document the specific blocker
3. Reference the blocking issue/task
4. Estimate when it might be unblocked
5. Suggest alternative approaches if any

### Task Self-Reference Pattern (Updated)
Each task implementation MUST:

1. **Update Progress in Real-Time**
   - Mark checklist items [x] as completed
   - Add completion timestamps for major milestones
   - Update task header status (✅/⚠️/❌) when appropriate

2. **Document Everything**
   - Add implementation notes directly in the task
   - Include file paths for all created/modified files
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs
   - Note any deviations from the plan with justification

3. **Verify Thoroughly**
   - Test each success criterion individually
   - Provide evidence of completion (test results, metrics)
   - Mark criteria with ✓ when verified, ✗ if failed
   - Never mark complete without full verification

4. **Maintain Context**
   - Reference findings from previous related tasks
   - Update subsequent tasks with learnings
   - Cross-reference with architecture and flow documentation
   - Note impacts on other components or tasks

5. **Communicate Status**
   - Use clear status indicators (✅ COMPLETED, ⚠️ PARTIAL, ❌ BLOCKED)
   - Include completion timestamp in format: "Completed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM"
   - Provide duration if significant (e.g., "Duration: 4 hours")
   - Leave clear handoff notes if task is incomplete

### Context Window Management
- Each phase designed to fit within ~40-60k tokens
- Tasks include clear boundaries and handoff points
- Dependencies explicitly stated for context loading
- **Priority Loading**: Always load focus-rearchitecture.md and current-focus-flow.md first
- Reference documents should remain in context throughout task execution

### Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures
- Each phase independently testable
- Rollback possible at any stage

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Focus transition time: <100ms
- Modal open/close: <150ms  
- Memory usage: <5MB
- Test coverage: >90%
- Accessibility score: 100

### Qualitative
- No focus loops or dead ends
- Predictable navigation
- Screen reader compatible
- Easy to debug

## Current Status
**Phase**: Not Started
**Blocked By**: None
**Next Action**: Begin Task 001 - Create FocusManagerContext

## Notes
- Missing SideEffectsSelection.tsx must be created (Task 015)
- Heavy timeout usage (50ms/100ms) will be completely removed
- Auto-open modal pattern will be eliminated
- Validation blocking will include escape mechanisms
