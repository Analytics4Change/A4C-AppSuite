# Code-Documentation Alignment Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive 10-week plan to align the A4C-FrontEnd codebase with the superior patterns documented in CLAUDE.md. The project orchestrator identified significant gaps where the documentation describes better implementation patterns than what currently exists in the code, particularly in accessibility compliance, focus management, and component architecture.

**Project Status**: 游늶 **PLANNED - AWAITING IMPLEMENTATION**

## Key Findings from Analysis

### Current State Assessment

- **Accessibility Compliance**: ~60% of components have complete ARIA attributes (Target: 100%)
- **E2E Accessibility Testing**: 0% coverage (Target: 100%)
- **Focus Management**: Inconsistent setTimeout usage (Target: All useEffect-based)
- **TabIndex Implementation**: Mixed approaches (Target: Documented sequential patterns)
- **Component Architecture**: Partial unified patterns (Target: Full standardization)

### Documentation vs Code Gaps Identified

| Area | Documentation Standard | Current Implementation | Gap |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|
| **ARIA Attributes** | Complete WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | ~60% coverage | Missing `aria-errormessage`, `aria-live`, `aria-current` |
| **Focus Management** | useEffect-based with proper restoration | setTimeout-based, inconsistent restoration | Refactor needed |
| **TabIndex Patterns** | Sequential numbering within components | Mixed explicit/natural approaches | Standardization needed |
| **Component Size** | 300 lines maximum | Some components exceed limit | Split large components |
| **Testing Framework** | E2E accessibility validation | No accessibility testing automation | Full framework needed |
