# Category Selection Keyboard Navigation Test Findings

## Executive Summary
E2E testing reveals that keyboard navigation is completely non-functional in the Therapeutic Classes and Regimen Categories checklist components due to a FocusBehaviorContext conflict that prevents the `useTabAsArrows` hook from activating.

## Test Results

### Successful Operations
- ✅ Enter key opens both checklists correctly
- ✅ Escape key closes checklists and returns focus to button
- ✅ Visual focus indicators appear correctly

### Failed Operations
- ❌ **Tab navigation**: Moves focus OUT of checklist to page elements instead of navigating between checkboxes
- ❌ **Space bar**: Does NOT toggle checkbox selection (0 items selected after pressing)
- ❌ **Arrow keys**: Do NOT navigate between checkboxes
- ❌ **Shift+Tab**: Moves focus backwards through page elements, not checklist items

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
Console logs reveal: `[useTabAsArrows] Tab NOT handled due to: isActive=false`

The `useTabAsArrows` hook is not activating despite:
1. Component has `data-focus-context="open"` attribute
2. Hook is enabled when dropdown is shown
3. Items array is populated

### Code Investigation

#### useTabAsArrows.ts (line 37)
```typescript
const isActive = useFocusBehavior('tab-as-arrows', enabled && items.length > 0);
```
The hook registers with FocusBehaviorContext but `isActive` returns false.

#### CategorySelectionEnhanced.tsx
- Lines 113-122: Therapeutic Classes setup with `enabled: showTherapeuticClasses`
- Lines 125-134: Regimen Categories setup with `enabled: showRegimenCategories`
- Lines 254, 330: Both have `data-focus-context="open"` 

### Architectural Conflict
The FocusBehaviorContext is designed to prevent conflicting keyboard behaviors (e.g., Tab-as-Arrows vs Enter-as-Tab). However, the context appears to be:
1. Not properly isolated to the checklist component
2. Potentially inherited from a parent component with conflicting behavior
3. Missing proper provider wrapping

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Context Isolation (Recommended)
Wrap each checklist in its own FocusBehaviorProvider to isolate the Tab-as-Arrows behavior:

```typescript
import { FocusBehaviorProvider } from '@/contexts/FocusBehaviorContext';

// In CategorySelectionEnhanced.tsx
{showTherapeuticClasses && (
  <FocusBehaviorProvider>
    <div id="therapeutic-classes-list" ...>
      {/* checklist content */}
    </div>
  </FocusBehaviorProvider>
)}
```

### Option 2: Direct Keyboard Handling
Bypass the FocusBehaviorContext system and implement direct keyboard handling:

```typescript
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (e.key === 'Tab') {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Direct navigation logic
  }
  // ... other keys
};
```

### Option 3: Modal Context Adjustment
Ensure the parent modal (MedicationEntryModal) isn't interfering with focus behavior:
- Check if modal has conflicting FocusBehaviorProvider
- Verify modal's useKeyboardNavigation hook configuration
- Consider `excludeSelectors` for checklist elements

## Testing Verification Plan

After implementing the chosen solution:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test FocusBehaviorContext isolation
   - Verify useTabAsArrows activation conditions
   - Test keyboard event propagation

2. **E2E Tests** 
   - Re-run `category-selection-keyboard-simplified.spec.ts`
   - Verify all keyboard combinations work:
     - Tab/Shift+Tab for navigation
     - Space for selection
     - Enter for closing with focus advancement
     - Escape for closing with focus return
     - Arrow keys for additional navigation

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA/JAWS)
   - Verify no focus traps
   - Test rapid keyboard navigation
   - Verify no conflicts with other modal behaviors

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact
- **High Priority**: Keyboard-only users cannot select medication categories
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level A violation (2.1.1 Keyboard)
- **Workflow**: Forces users to use mouse, breaking keyboard-only workflow

### Technical Impact
- Affects all dropdown checklist components using useTabAsArrows
- May indicate broader FocusBehaviorContext architecture issues
- Could affect other keyboard navigation patterns in the application

## Recommendation

Implement **Option 1 (Context Isolation)** as it:
- Maintains the existing architecture patterns
- Provides clear component boundaries
- Prevents future conflicts
- Is most maintainable long-term

The fix should be minimal (~10 lines) but requires careful testing to ensure no regression in other focus behaviors.

## Next Steps

1. Await architect approval on recommended solution
2. Implement approved solution
3. Run comprehensive test suite
4. Update documentation on FocusBehaviorContext usage patterns
5. Consider creating a reusable ChecklistDropdown component with built-in context isolation
