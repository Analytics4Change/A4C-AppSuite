# TabIndex Refactoring Report

## Summary
Successfully refactored tabIndex values across the medication management page to be consecutive whole numbers from 1-17, with proper conditional handling for dependent fields.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Therapeutic Class References
- Updated comment in DosageTimingsInput.tsx from "Therapeutic Classes at tabIndex 12" to "Date Selection at tabIndex 10"

### 2. Renumbered TabIndex Values

#### Before (with gaps: 5, 7, 11, 12):
- MedicationSearch: 1
- MedicationAuxiliary: 2, 3
- DosageForm: 4
- DosageRoute: 6 (conditional)
- DosageAmount: 8
- DosageUnit: 9 (conditional)
- DosageFrequency: 10
- DosageTimings: baseTabIndex=11, nextTabIndex=12
- DateSelection: 13, 14
- PharmacyInfo: 15, 16, 17, 18
- InventoryQuantity: 19, 20

#### After (consecutive 1-17):
- MedicationSearch: 1
- MedicationAuxiliary: 2, 3
- DosageForm: 4
- DosageRoute: 5 (conditional: `dosageForm ? 5 : -1`)
- DosageAmount: 6
- DosageUnit: 7 (conditional: `dosageRoute ? 7 : -1`)
- DosageFrequency: 8
- DosageTimings: baseTabIndex=9, nextTabIndex=10
- DateSelection: 10, 11
- PharmacyInfo: 12, 13, 14, 15
- InventoryQuantity: 16, 17

### 3. Fixed Cancel Focus Behavior

#### DosageTimingsInput.tsx:
```typescript
const handleCancel = () => {
  viewModel.reset();
  onTimingsChange([]);
  onClose?.();
  // Focus next element (Date Selection at tabIndex 10)
  const nextElement = document.querySelector('[tabindex="10"]') as HTMLElement;
  nextElement?.focus();
};
```

### 4. Files Modified
1. `src/views/medication/DosageTimingsInput.tsx`
2. `src/views/medication/DosageFormInputsEditable.tsx`
3. `src/views/medication/DosageFrequencyInput.tsx`
4. `src/views/medication/DateSelectionSimplified.tsx`
5. `src/views/medication/PharmacyInformationInputs.tsx`
6. `src/views/medication/InventoryQuantityInputs.tsx`

## Conditional TabIndex Preservation
The conditional nature of Dosage Route and Dosage Unit fields has been preserved:
- **Dosage Route**: Only focusable when Dosage Form is selected (`dosageForm ? 5 : -1`)
- **Dosage Unit**: Only focusable when Dosage Route is selected (`dosageRoute ? 7 : -1`)

## Expected Behavior After Changes

### Tab Navigation Flow:
1. Tab key advances through fields in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → (5 if enabled) → 6 → (7 if enabled) → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17
2. Fields 5 and 7 are skipped when their conditions aren't met

### Cancel Behavior from Dosage Timings:
- **Escape at checkbox level**: Cancels and focuses Date Selection (tabIndex 10)
- **Tab to Cancel button + Enter**: Cancels and focuses Date Selection (tabIndex 10)
- **Click Cancel with mouse**: Cancels and focuses Date Selection (tabIndex 10)
- **Next Tab press**: Advances to Discontinue Date (tabIndex 11)

### Continue Behavior from Dosage Timings:
- Saves selections and focuses Date Selection (tabIndex 10)
- Next Tab press advances to Discontinue Date (tabIndex 11)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to medication management page
2. Use Tab key to verify sequential navigation (1-17)
3. Verify Dosage Route (5) is skipped when Dosage Form is empty
4. Verify Dosage Unit (7) is skipped when Dosage Route is empty
5. Test Cancel from Dosage Timings - should focus Date Selection
6. Test Continue from Dosage Timings - should focus Date Selection

### Keyboard Navigation Test:
- Tab forward through entire form
- Shift+Tab backward through entire form
- Enter key advances in input fields
- Escape key cancels in Dosage Timings

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Navigation**: No gaps in tabIndex sequence
2. **Predictable Focus**: Cancel/Continue from Dosage Timings always goes to Date Selection
3. **Maintained Conditionals**: Dependent fields remain properly disabled
4. **WCAG Compliance**: Follows sequential tabIndex guidelines from CLAUDE.md
